As per our yesterday's telephonic round, I am providing you the task for round 2. Please find below task for you. 

Task Details
1) Create a Nodejs Server. 
2) Keep the below json file in a folder "config"

3) Need two routes in Nodejs Server. (i) for getting this configuration file (ii) 
for printing the "pathatserver" & the "ip" parameter of the json whenever a user 
will click on the button "Execute" for any server

4) Use angular to create a UI to show this json in a nice format
  (you have full freedom to design the screen). Basically the UI must show
  all the server groups along with all the servers within that group. 
  Each server within a servergroup will have a button "Execute". 
  On click of this button a function in the above created nodejs server 
  must be called and it should print in console the 
  ip address of the server,
  server group name 
  and 
  the pathatserver (defined in the json) parameter.
